<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Rishabh Subramanian, currently pursuing my B.Tech. at the esteemed National Institute of Technology, 
  Karnataka, Surathkal. I was born in Mumbai and brought up in the city of Abu Dhabi. I hail from Tamil Nadu in India.</p>

<p>When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away, you'll probably find me with earphones in, lost in the melodies of 
  my favorite music, or on the badminton court, giving it my all. There's something about the rhythm of a good song or 
  the thrill of a well-played match that just energizes me.</p>

<p>One quote that really speaks to me is, "Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most." 
  It's a constant reminder for me to stay focused on my goals, to prioritize what truly matters, even when faced with 
  tempting distractions. So yeah, that's me â€“ balancing studies, passions, and the journey of self-discovery, one day 
  at a time.</p>
